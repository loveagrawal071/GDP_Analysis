# GDP_Analysis
GDP analysis of all states of India.
NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank of the Government of India which provides strategic inputs to the central and the state governments to achieve various development goals. In the past, NITI Aayog has played an important role in initiatives such as Digital India, Atal Innovation Mission, various agricultural reforms etc. and have designed various policies in education, skill development, water management, healthcare, etc. 
We are working as the chief data scientist at NITI Aayog, reporting to the CEO. The CEO has initiated a project wherein the NITI Aayog will provide top-level recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to states as well.
The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas which will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, you will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.
